title: Check out my Pass the Butter Project!
---

Inspired by Butter Robot in the tv show Rick and Morty, I want to a build a low cost robot that can pass the butter. As in, you can tell your robot "Go pass me the butter", and it will drive along your kitchen table searching for the butter. And when it finds the butter, it'll push it back along the table to you, ready for your toast in the morning.

To see and contribute to the project, go over to [Pass the Butter](https://github.com/robolity/pass-the-butter/) and fork the repo.

This will require interesting and challenging autonomous navigation techniques, and implementing them to work with a real-world robot using sensors for feedback. Also, a key aim is to make it work with really basic robots that cost less than $100 to build. My motivation for this project is to learn all this myself, and hopefully develop an open source robot kit and software that is super accessible and gets people into robotics!

If you want to help develop this project, or have any questions at all, please contact me at robolity@gmail.com. I'll be super happy to hear from you!
