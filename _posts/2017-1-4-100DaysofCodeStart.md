title: Taking on the 100 Days of Code Challenge
---

Back in Septemeber last year, I decided to create the [Pass the Butter](https://github.com/robolity/pass-the-butter/) project to develop a low cost robot kit for advanced autonomous navigation techniques, while learning about python coding, mechatronics and robotic algorithms. 

Unfortunately my enthusiasm in the project was short lived. A dream job opportunity in robotics came up at this same time, and so applying and transitioning to this new role has consumed all my time. And even though the Pass the Butter project has been niggling at the back of my mind, I've been unable to get back into the project. 

This all changed over the holiday break. I listened to the Code Newbie [@CodeNewbie](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) podcast with Alexander Kallaway [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) explaining about the 100 Days of Code Challenge he created. The [podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code) ws really inspirational to listen to, as it highlighted a lot of the reasons why I hadn't worked on this project for the past 3 months. It was all about creating consistency and coding on a daily basis, so that it becomes habit. And adding social accountability through twitter was a really interesting idea to me, as it's something I've never tried before. So here goes, I'm plunging head first into this challenge, and hopefully come out the other side with Pass the Butter autonomously searching for the butter, rather than being an idea gathering dust.

The full rules and details of the challenge can be found at [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.52dtn5xbq). I really encourage you to give it a go too!
