Hi, my name's Justin.

I'm a robotics system engineer by day, and hope to create my own friendly robots by night. I've worked in industrial robotics in the past and now in agricultural research robotics with the Australian Centre for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney. With a strong background in the mechanical design of machines and robots, I'm looking to build on my software and electronics skills and hopefully develop educational robotic kits. My aim is to develop a kit that makes robotics cheap and accessible (<$100) while still applying advanced robotics concepts, such as path planning, control algorithms and machine vision

### More Information

If you'd like to help me out with my mission, please play around with or contribute to my [Pass the Butter](https://github.com/robolity/pass-the-butter/) project. The code is in python, a really easy language to get the hang of. The robot I use is a Pololu Zumo32U4 with a Raspberry Pi 3 on top, but the software is designed so that the robot can easily be changed.

At this stage, a lot of the inspiration for the code is from the (Control of Mobile Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot) Coursera course. I'd like to include the path and planning algorithms from [Robotics: Computational Motion Planning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-motion-planning) Coursera course as well. I suggest you do these courses if you are interested in contributing, or just looking for some really good robotics courses.
